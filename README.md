# Seashore Grasp

## Inspiration
For learning, we often have to move across from one site to another either in the search of one of the topics or resuming the topics we are learning which sometimes distracts the individual and results in wastage of time. 

## What it does
This application has a personalized setup learning resource where users can tune in and switch between different learning platforms without being distracted. Also, by this application user would have a centralized platform to look after and could make the learning journey smooth.

## How we built it
This application is simply built by HTML, CSS, Javascript. 

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Interactive Interface of the website

## What I have learned
How to create a good UI experience for users?
